### Query Form

#### For the frontend part :-
1. The frontend of the app is made with the help of REACT JS (Here, I have used functional components) and Material UI.

2. User will be a given a form to submit his query.

4. After you click the submit button form is submitted to the backend and user is redirected to the thankyou page Or if there is any issue from server side user will be redirected to error page.

5. The default port that this frontend is running is 3000.

#### For the backend part
1. Backend/Server of the app is made with the help of Express Js which handle routes related to submit.
2. The database that I have used is mongodb which is using mongoose on top of it for creating the schemas and adding data to mongodb.
4. The default port that this backend is running is 9000
5. Different packages used :
    -> express js (For creating server)
    -> mongoose (For creating the schema and adding data to the mongodb)
    -> cors (For allowing cross origins to make request to the backend)
